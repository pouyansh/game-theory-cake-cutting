This project had 3 parts and in each part, the task was cutting cake in an envy-free way. each part had some assumptions which you could see 
below:
  - a: There are n people and each of them likes a continuous part of the cake uniformly and none of the part is a subset of another.
  - b: There are 3 people and each of them could have many parts that he likes them uniformly.
  - c: There are n people and each of them likes a continuous part of the cake uniformly.
